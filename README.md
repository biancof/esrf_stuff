# esrf_stuff

In this repository, you can find some macros I have been developing during my working period (October-November 2017) at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) in Grenoble.
My purpose was to implement some tools to control and change the position of the spectrometer on BM23.
The macros have been used during the scientific experiments of the beamline in December 2017.
They have been written in SPEC, "a UNIX-based software package for instrument control and data acquisition", used in such facilities.
Further info on SPEC at https://certif.com/spec.html.
